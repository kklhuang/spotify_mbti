# spotify_mbti

## What is it?:
I've always loved learning about people's MBTI, and I was extremely excited when Spotify included a "listening personality" in their 2022 Spotify Wrapped. However, I was curious if I could replicate that idea, but in my own way. I also wanted it to be something I could constantly refer back to, since Spotify's version of it disappears after the Spotify Wrapped season. That what inspired this passion project! 

## Starting the app:
```
cd client 
npm i  
cd ..
cd authorization_code 
npm i 
node app.js
cd ..
cd client 
npm start 
```

## Notes:
Due to the nature of the Spotify Dashboard behaviour and permissions, this currently only works for my own personal account.
